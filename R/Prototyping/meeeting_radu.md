# Meeting agenda 


1. **Discuss the possible final final results of the improved version of our paper**


- Currently I am running experiments for 23 datasets * 10 distinct versions (230 in total) and only the 50% is completed.
- __A quick reminder:__
Arthur & Ricardo at our last attempt demanded significant improvement in all the datasets that we had included in our experimental setting 19 datasets * 3 distinct versions. This requirement will be difficult to meet because there is no universe best approach; No free lunch theorem. 


 *Imagine you have 100 different regression problems and you model them with Linear Regression and Neural Network. There will be datasets where the LR outperforms the NN and vice versa. The reason might be the dimensionality, the linear or non linear feature relationships, intristic characteristics etc. In the same analogy, it will be hard to achieve significant improvement and we will be in the same situation as the last time.*


1.1 What are our options? 

- We have to find a smart way to present/justify the subset of datasets where we achieve the significant improvement. 

- Present the non significant improvement as the rest researchers have done at their papers with similar approach to ours. Probably the final results will be better than the baseline but without significance. 


2. **Do we have a plan B in case the results are not publishable?**

- Plan A is to submit to ECML (March 26) and then start writing my thesis. 

- Since we are doing research we do not have a guarantee that our proposed method will work. We experimentally investigate the validity of our novel ideas. *Will the defence will be affected?* 

3. **Can we set a tangible plan to defend the latest in August?**
- Timeline 
- Future opportunities? 

4. **Do you need more experiments from the existing published papers?** 

- My current situation is already challenging and frustrating; submitting an A conference paper & writing my thesis. All of my past experiments need a lot of time to re-perform them
