# Learning Unsupervised Representations to Detect Novelty


- First Run the src.R script having as possible values "macBook" or "sherlock". You can also create you own or modify the existing values

- This repo is for leveraging the outlier scores produced by various OD algorithms. Here you can find all the datasets that outlier scores have been pre-computed http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/research/outlier-evaluation/DAMI/


- Sofiane the function that I have commented for you is the "R/Functional/OCSVM_pipeline.R". I have implemented the functions inside this script in order to be easily parellizable. I have impression that also you will not find it easy. In addition, I am very interested in discussing what could be the script that runs automatically all the dataets or discussing how to automate the whole pipeline as much as possible.
